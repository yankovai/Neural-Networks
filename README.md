Neural-Networks
===============

The Python code included in this repository will ultimately create a neural network to find patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns. Primarily, I wrote this code to help cement my understanding of neural networks. If you can successfully code an algorithm then you understand it, right? 

The algorithm for creating a neural network here is based on Andrew Ng's notes presented during his Machine Learning Coursera.

Everything here is currently under construction...
